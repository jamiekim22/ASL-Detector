# ASL Recognition Web Application

This application is currently in development! Features may not be implemented yet.


A modern web application for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and translation using machine learning and computer vision.

## üéØ Project Overview

This application provides real-time ASL recognition capabilities through a user-friendly web interface. Users can interact with the system through video input to receive instant translations of ASL gestures into text and speech.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time ASL Recognition**: Live video processing for instant sign language detection
- **Text Translation**: Convert recognized signs to readable text
- **Speech Synthesis**: Audio output of translated content
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive web-based interface
- **Learning Mode**: Educational tools for ASL learning
- **Progress Tracking**: User progress and learning analytics
- **Multi-user Support**: User accounts and personalized experiences

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11**: Core application language
- **MediaPipe**: Hand tracking
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Machine learning model
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **NumPy/Scikit-learn**: Data processing
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time web communication
- **Javascript, HTML/CSS**: Frontend web display and overlays

## üöÄ Quick Start
